    There are many different ways to join multiple streams into one. There exist
    the following strategies:
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Interleave events by merging streams</i> - This strategy is useful for
    forwarding events from multiple streams and is ideal for handling different
    types of user interaction events like mouse or touch.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Preserve order of events by concatenating streams</i> - This one is used
    when the order of the events emitted by multiple streams needs to be
    preserved.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Switch to the latest stream data</i> - This is used when one type of
    event kicks off another, such as a button click initiating a remote HTTP
    call or beginning a timer.

  <h2>Joining Streams with "Flat" Data into One</h2>
  <p style="padding: 10px;">
    Operators <i>merge()</i>,<i> concat()</i>, and <i>switchAll()</i>, grouped
    observable data in a flat manner, each with a different strategy. In other
    words, youâ€™re receiving events from one source or another and processing
    them accordingly. All these operators have
    <i><strong>higher-order observable</strong></i> equivalents, which handle
    nested observables.

  <p style="padding: 10px;">
    DEFINITION. The term
    <i><strong>higher-order observable</strong></i> originates from the notion
    of a <i>higher-order function</i>, which can receive other functions as
    parameters. In this case, we mean observables that receive other observables
    as arguments.
